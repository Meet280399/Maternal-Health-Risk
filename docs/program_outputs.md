## Tables

Raw data (unrounded) used to generate the tables in each report are present
in `.csv` files in the same folder as the Markdown (`.md`) reports.

Compressed forms of each table are also often saved in `.parquet` [file
format](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/) in each directory.
